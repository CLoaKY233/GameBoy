Boostify is a high-performance desktop application built with Tauri and Rust that provides precise control over system power management and processor optimization settings. The application leverages native Windows power management capabilities through direct Rust implementation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Native Power Management**: Pure Rust implementation for system power control
- **Processor Optimization**: Advanced boost mode management
- **Dual Power Profiles**: Seamless AC/DC power mode switching
- **Secure Operations**: Native privilege elevation handling
- **Modern Interface**: React-based UI with real-time feedback
- **Performance Focused**: Low resource footprint with Rust backend

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **UI Framework**: ShadcnUI
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Rust (latest stable)
- Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools
- Windows 10/11
- Administrative privileges

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloaky233/GameBoy.git
